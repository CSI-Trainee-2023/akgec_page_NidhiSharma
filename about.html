            diverse industry segments like automotive, industrial machinery, industrial automation, aerospace and
            shipbuilding.<br><br>

            To promote Industry oriented teaching learning, AKGEC has setup Centre for Integrated Automation in
            association with Automation Industry Association (AIA). This initiative of AIA is intended to share global
            quality learning processes from its vast pool of member companies with chosen Engineering Colleges of our
            country. Industry partners namely Siemens, Pepperel + Fuchs, Festo and B&R have taken the lead among all
            industry members of AIA to support the initiative. Main objective of this Centre is to encourage engineering
            students to take up this multidisciplinary field as a choice of their career and get hands-on experience
            with latest state-of-the-art integrated automation technologies as per industry expectations.<br><br>

            The College has also set up U.P.'s first Industrial Pneumatic Knowledge Centre (IPKC) in collaboration with
            Janatics, Coimbatore. The initiative of setting up IPKC reflects Janatics' endeavour to contribute towards
            producing skilled workforce in Pneumatics which will help manufacturing sector to adopt to changes related
            to automation in substantive way. The IPKC also functions as National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC)
            Training-cum-Incubation Centre.<br><br>

            Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College, jointly with Fronius International GmbH has set up India's first
            Advanced Welding Technology and Research Centre (AWTRC) in the state of Uttar Pradesh. AWTRC has been
            established with an aim of developing outstanding infrastructure for becoming a globally recognized source
            of a competitive workforce and cost-effective, superior-performing welding technologies by conducting
            training, research and development in the field of welding science, engineering and automation
            technology.<br><br>

            AKGEC, jointly with SIEMENS, has set up Advance Manufacturing Centre for SMEs and educational institutions
            at Ghaziabad. The AKGEC- Siemens Training Centre is setup to produce highly skilled technical manpower in
            the field of Advance Manufacturing. The trained manpower will help Indian Manufacturing Industry to adopt
            latest technologies to improve quality and work conditions with high productivity. This collaborative effort

            the field of manufacturing and Reverse Engineering.<br><br>

            Fab Lab is an initiative of Prof. Neil Gershenfeld from MIT, USA which is typically equipped with an array
            of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with
            the aim to make “almost anything". AKGEC has established Fab Lab in response to the need arising from
            students requiring a dedicated space and appropriate equipment to develop their projects. Since then it
            evolved from being just a product development Centre to a facility focused on promoting innovation,
            imparting much-needed skills for innovators and help developing competency across different disciplines
            including mechanical, electronics and embedded development areas.<br><br>

            The efforts of the college to bridge the gap between academic curriculum and industry requirements through
            these centers of Excellence & Competence have been recognized and the college is the recipient of the CMAI
            Best Industry Interface award from the Hon'ble Minister of Science & Technology, UP Govt.<br><br>

            AKGEC in its endeavor to promote technical competency of engineering graduates, Diploma and ITI candidates
            has established Skill Development Centre in collaboration with National Skill Development Corporation
            (NSDC), Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Govt. of India under AKGEC Skills Foundation. This
            initiative is supported by reputed multinational industries of Europe like SIEMENS, Fronius, Messer and Carl
            Zeiss as per the International didactic concepts. This centre has world class State-of-the-art

            Robotic Arc Welding, Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) and High-End Reverse Engineering processes.<br><br>

            In addition, the College has established the Big Data Centre of Excellence, Software Development Centre and
            Open Source Software Research & Development lab. These centers are run and managed entirely by the students
            to promote software development for the college as well as external clients, conduct training programs in
            various technologies and host competitions.<br><br>

            As a result of these initiatives, the college has been having excellent campus placements. During the
            current academic year, over 800 students have been placed in PSUs and reputed organizations like Infosys,
            HCL Technologies, L&T, L&T Infotech, Hyundai, Wipro Technologies, Jakson Engineers Ltd., NTPC, IBM, Indian
            Air Force and the Indian Army.

            The main distinguishing features of the college have been uniform transparent policies and systems as well
            as uncompromising honesty in every facet of its activities. The college believes in setting audacious goals
            and infusing fresh ideas to achieve them.<br>
